# etch-a-sketch
This project, involves creating a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This project should not be easy. I’ll probably have to Google frequently to find the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use – in fact, that’s the point! I can build this using the tools that you have already learned. There are plenty of resources on the net for learning stuff that haven’t been covered yet if you decide you need it. 

Good luck!!!
